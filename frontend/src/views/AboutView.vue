    <h2>What is Song of the Week?</h2>
    <p>
      Song of the Week is meant to be a friendly competition where you and your friends can finally determine who has
      the best music taste through democracy! I guess this also allows you to introduce your friends to new music and
      learn more about them as you go along, creating a deeper understanding and connection between you, forming a bond
      that will last lifetimes or something, but it's mostly about winning.
    </p>
    <h3>How does the competition work?</h3>
    <p>
      Every week, you and whoever else is a part of your Song of the Week competition submit a song anonymously in a
      survey. Once everyone has submitted a song, a Spotify playlist composed of everyone's submission is created and
      made available to everyone in the competition. Over the course of the next week, you and your friends will listen
      to the playlist and fill out the next survey before the week ends. Each survey (except for the very first one)
      will have you pick your favorite two songs from the playlist that week (votes for your own song are not counted
      for that song), match each of the players in the competition with one of the songs in the playlist, and submit a
      new song for next week's playlist. The results of the previous week's survey will be shown on a scheduled day and
      time once everyone has submitted a response and it will show everyone which song(s) got the most votes, which
      players got the most and least correct matches, and a breakdown of who voted for which song and who made each
      guess. The top voted song(s) each week will be added to a Song of the Year playlist available to everyone. The
      next playlist and a new survey will also be released with the previous week's results, and thus, the circle of
      Song of the Week continues.
